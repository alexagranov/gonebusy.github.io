## Sandbox

We have a Sandbox environment to play with!

Just use [sandbox.gonebusy.com](http://sandbox.gonebusy.com) instead of where you see beta.gonebusy.com referenced, including where to create an account to retrieve your API Key.  

The Sandbox environment is completely separate from the Live site - that includes meaning your Sandbox API Key will not work in the Live environment.

## How to Build

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). To build a Jekyll site you'll need a few things on your system so double check the [Jekyll requirements](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

### Install Bundler

```bash
$> gem install bundler
```

### Clone your own fork of gonebusy.github.io

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/<your_user>/gonebusy.github.io.git
```

### Install all Gem dependencies

```bash
$> cd gonebusy.github.io
$> bundle install
```

### Run Jekyll webserver

```bash
$> jekyll serve
```

By default `jekyll` will listen on port 4000 so browse to http://localhost:4000 to see your changes!
