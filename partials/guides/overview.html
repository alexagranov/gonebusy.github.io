  <h4>Basic Users</h4>
  <p>When you first sign up, you are a Basic User.  A Basic User cannot create any Resources, the only Resource they have is themselves.  A Basic User can create Services/Activities but they must be offered at no charge.  Basic User accounts are free for the first year, and $1 per year after the first year.</p>
</section>
<section class='anchor-container push-down' id='pro'>
  <h4>Pro Users</h4>
  <p>Any Basic account can be upgraded to a Pro account. Pro Users are able to create additional Resources under their account.  These Resources can have their own Schedules as well as Services/Activities offered.  Pro Users are also able to offer Services/Activities at a price to the customer.  The price of a Service/Activity can be fixed for the duration of the appointment, hourly, or various other options.  Pro User accounts are still free for the first year and $1 per year after the first year.  GoneBusy does charge a nominal 2.5% + 50&cent; fee of a successfully completed Booking (see description of Bookings).</p>

<section class='anchor-container push-down' id='access'>
  <h4>Gaining Access to the API</h4>
  <p>Pro Users automatically gain access to the GoneBusy API.  The API allows for the creation and management of the Pro Userâ€™s Resources, Services/Activities, Schedules and Bookings.</p>
</section>
<section class='anchor-container push-down' id='manager'>
  <h4>Account Manager</h4>
  <p>The API allows creation of other accounts for which the Pro User becomes the defacto Account Manager.  The Pro User, via API, can then create and manage Resources, Services/Activities, and Schedules of Users for which they are the Account Manager.  Account Managers have only limited access to manage the Bookings of their managed Users.</p>
  <p>Any Users created via API are completely viewable and have their Services and Schedules accessible by customers on the GoneBusy website.</p>
</section>
<section class='anchor-container push-down' id='affiliates'>
  <h4>The Affiliate Program</h4>
  <p>By prior written arrangement, a Pro User can become an Affiliate of GoneBusy.  If any Bookings are initiated on the GoneBusy website for Users created by Affiliates, the Affiliate receives a commission on every successfully completed Booking (see description of Bookings).</p>
