  <h4>Gaining Access to the API</h4>
  <p>All Users automatically gain access to the GoneBusy API.  The API allows for the creation and management of the Userâ€™s Resources, Services, Schedules and Bookings.</p>
  <p>The API Key for access can be found under the "API Key" menu option on the User's dashboard.</p>

  <h4>Account Manager</h4>
  <p>The API allows creation of other User accounts for which the User becomes the defacto Account Manager.  The Account Manager User can then create and manage Resources, Services, and Schedules of the Users for which they are the Account Manager.  Account Managers have only limited access to manage the Bookings of their managed Users.</p>
