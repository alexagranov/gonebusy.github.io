  <h4>Step 3.2 - (Optional) Associate a Price Model with Service</h4>
  <p>The Service created in Step 3 above was not Associated with a PricingModel during creation.  Recall that a Service defaults to having Activity pricing if no PricingModel is specified, which means it must be offered at no charge.  If we want to charge for our new Service, letâ€™s create an appropriate PricingModel and associate it with our Service.</p>
  <p>Here is a sample POST request to create a PricingModel:</p>
  <h3 class="green">Request:</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
http://beta.gonebusy.com/api/v1/pricing_models/new.json
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>with POST body:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
  "type": "ByTheHour",
  "price": 50.0,
  "name": "Tutoring Hourly Rate",
  "notes": "Applies to LSAT, MCAT, SAT as well"
{% endhighlight %}
  <h3 class='green push-down'>Response:</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
  "Status": "201 Created"

  {
    "pricing_model": {
      "id": 126,
      "owner_id": 54,
      "name": "Tutoring Hourly Rate",
      "price": 50.0,
      "currency": "USD",
      "notes": "Applies to LSAT, MCAT, SAT as well",
      "pricing_model_type": "ByTheHour"
    }
  }
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>We can now assign our recently created Service to this PricingModel using the ID of the PricingModel we just created:</p>
  <h3 class="green">Request:</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}

  <p>with PUT body:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
  "price_model_id": "126"
{% endhighlight %}
  <h3 class='green push-down'>Response:</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
  "Status": "200 OK"
