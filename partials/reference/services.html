<h2 class="reference-heading">Services</h2>
<section>
  <p>Bookings on GoneBusy would not be possible without users offering their Services/Activities.  Services can be anything that someone, or a group of professionals at a business, offers for a fee that requires a time commitment.  Activities also require a time commitment but don’t require charging a fee – for instance, Activities are things one shares with friends.</p>
